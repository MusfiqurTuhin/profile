This is an incredibly powerful and rare profile. You are bridging three distinct worlds that usually don't overlap: High-level Academic AI/Tech, Grassroots Activism/Politics, and Arts/Literature.

A standard "portfolio" (About Me -> Resume -> Contact) will fail you. It will feel too flat. You need a "Digital Universe" or "Scrollytelling Narrative" approach that allows these distinct identities to coexist without cluttering each other.

Here is a conceptual framework, design strategy, and tech stack to handle this specific mix of "extreme code" capability and "raw human story."

1. The Core Concept: "The Organized Chaos" (Bento or Node-Based)
Since you have distinct eras (2015–2018 Social, 2024 Activism, 2025 AI/Research) and distinct modes (Artist vs. Engineer), I suggest one of these two conceptual directions:

Option A: The 3D Constellation (Interactive Graph)
The Vibe: High-tech, AI-driven, futuristic.

The Visual: A 3D interactive graph (nodes floating in space).

How it works:

Each "Node" is a project or role (e.g., one node is "RiceResQ," another is "July Movement," another is "Muktanchol").

Nodes are color-coded by category: Red for Activism, Blue for Research/AI, Yellow for Art/Lit.

When the user hovers/clicks, the camera zooms into that "world."

Why: It visually proves your "multitudes" instantly. It shows that your Literature work is connected to your Social work, and your AI work stands tall alongside it.

Option B: The "Scrollytelling" Timeline (The Journey)
The Vibe: Emotional, story-driven, cinematic.

The Visual: A vertical scroll that moves through time.

Structure:

Intro: "The Engineer, The Activist, The Artist."

Section 1: The Foundation (2013-2020): Sepia/Warm tones. Show the badges, the "Child Journalist" ID, the "Scout" photos. This establishes your roots in service.

Section 2: The Revolution (July 2024 - Jan 2026): High contrast, black and white, gritty. Full-screen video backgrounds of the protests you led. This is the "Impact" section.

Section 3: The Innovation (Present): Clean, minimal, dark mode. Your IEEE papers, the violencetracker.org live demo, the Metamorphosis work.

2. Section Breakdown & Content Strategy
Here is how to organize your specific data points so they hit hard.

I. The "Research Lab" (Academic & Professional)
Style: Clean, grid-based, data-heavy.

Highlight:

The Metrics: "7 Papers | 6 IEEE | 1 Springer." Put these numbers in big bold typography.

Paper Cards: Don't just list titles. Use cards that flip or expand to show the impact:

Plant Disease (ECCE 2025): "95% Accuracy • Solving National Crop Loss."

Traffic Signs (BIM 2023): "2K+ Custom Dataset • ViT Model."

Live Tech: Embed a mini-version of your violencetracker.org or a simplified version of your "Plant Disease" model directly into the site so people can "play" with your AI.

II. The "War Room" (Activism & Leadership)
Style: Brutalist, bold typography, raw imagery.

Content:

The "July Movement" Gallery: Use a masonry layout for the photos/videos. Keep the captions short and powerful.

NPA Section: "Building the Future." List your role as Tech Lead & Organizer. Focus on the system building aspect—how you are applying engineering structure to political organization.

III. The "Studio" (Art, Literature & Early Era)
Style: Artistic, collage-style, "scrapbook" feel.

Content:

Book Covers: Display the covers you designed as a horizontal scroll.

Writings: "Muktanchol Sahittya." Excerpts of your editorials.

The "Social Era" (2015-2020): Create a "Hall of Badges" section. Visually display the logos of Ovizatri, Hand For Help, Tarunno Society. It shows longevity and dedication.

3. The Tech Stack (For "Extreme Codes")
Since you are a Fullstack/ML Engineer and want to flex your skills, do not use a template. Build this from scratch to serve as its own portfolio piece.

Framework: Next.js 15 (App Router). It’s fast, SEO-friendly (crucial for your papers to be found), and you already know it.

Animation Library: GSAP (GreenSock) or Framer Motion.

Why: You need complex scroll-triggered animations (e.g., text fading in as you scroll through the "July Movement" timeline).

3D Elements (The "Aesthetic"): React Three Fiber (R3F).

Idea: Create a 3D "network" background that reacts to the mouse. The nodes represent your different skills connecting.

Idea: A 3D book that opens to show your literary work.

CMS (Content Management): Sanity.io.

Why: You have diverse data (Papers, Photos, Videos, Text). Sanity allows you to create custom schemas for "Papers," "Events," and "Artworks" easily.

Performance: Since you have "too many photos/videos" from the movement, use Cloudinary or Mux for video optimization. Don't slow down the site.

4. Special Feature Idea: "The Mode Switcher"
Add a physical toggle switch in the UI header:

"Corporate Mode": Filters the site to show only AI Research, ML Engineering (Metamorphosis), and Academic achievements. (Safe for applying to PhDs/Scholarships).

"Story Mode": Unlocks the full experience—The Activism, The Literature, The Social Work, The Art. (For the general public and to show your true self).

i have a versatile profile, which i want to show at my website with astethic. so my website cant be just one portfolio focused. My academic work reflects my commitment to leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) for solving real-world problems. I have authored and co-authored three peer-reviewed papers published in major international conferences. I authored 7 peer-reviewed ieeXplore 6, 1 springer nature paper.

i was one of the top leader of private universities student during july movement. There is too many photos videos here.  i also led university students protests. 

 after july, jan 2026 a new political platforms named NPA comes, i am one of the organizer of this, tech lead, actively working to building the party.

i graduated from uiu, cse, major data science. currently working as profession machine learning engineer at metamorphosis ltd. 

also working some research papers. 

previously i was Independent Freelancer (Graphic & Web Developer), Delivering end-to-end branding and website  solutions for clients across multiple industries.
